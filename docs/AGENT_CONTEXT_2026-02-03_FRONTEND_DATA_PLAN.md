# AGENT CONTEXT — 2026-02-03 — Frontend Data Integration Plan

- Updated `frontend/docs/DATA_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` with Phase 3 flow and integration details for matrix, heatmap, and line modes.
- Ensured plan keeps preview as initial render and defers `/data` until user interaction.
- No frontend code changes.
