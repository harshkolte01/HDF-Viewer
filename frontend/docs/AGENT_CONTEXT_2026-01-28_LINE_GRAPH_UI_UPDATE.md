# Agent Context (2026-01-28) - Line Graph UI Update

Updated the line graph UI with line-specific toolbar controls (grid toggle, aspect mode, export placeholder) and added an interactive line chart with pan, zoom, hover index/value readout, and fullscreen support. The line view layout now places the graph below the dimension selection with X-only axis buttons.
